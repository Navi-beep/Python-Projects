#Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

def minimum(arr):
    #minimum = minimum
    return min(arr)
    

def maximum(arr):
    return max(arr)

arr = [100,-1111,3,45,6,7,5656]
print(minimum(arr))
print(maximum(arr))


arr2 = [100,-1111,3,45,6,7,4545323]
