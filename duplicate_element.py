#Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

#You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

#An algorithm has linear complexity if the time taken increases linearly with the increase in the number of inputs. 

#O(1) Complexity: We consider constant space complexity when the program doesnâ€™t contain any loop, recursive function, or call to any other functions. 

#O(n) Complexity: We consider the linear space complexity when the program contains any loops.

#Example 1:

#Input: nums = [2,2,1]
#Output: 1
