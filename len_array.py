#You are given an array of integers arr, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subarray.
#A continuous increasing subarray is defined as 2 or more consecutive indices such that arr[i] < arr[i+1].

#Input: arr = [1,3,5,4,7]
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subarray is [1,3,5] with length 3.
#Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subarray, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
#4.
